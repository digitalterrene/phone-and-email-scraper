## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/digitalterrene/phone-and-email-scraper.git
   cd phone-and-email-scraper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```

---

## **Usage**

1. **Prepare URLs**  
   Add the list of URLs to scrape in the `urls.js` file:

   ```javascript
   const urls = [
     "http://www.example1.com",
     "http://www.example2.com",
     // Add more URLs here
   ];
   module.exports = { urls };
   ```

2. **Run the Scraper**  
   Start the script with:

   ```bash
   node scrape.js
   ```

3. **Output**
   - Extracted data will be saved in `data.csv` in the same directory.
   - Each row includes the page URL, phone numbers, and email addresses.

## **File Structure**

```
phone-and-email-scraper/
â”œâ”€â”€ scrape.js      # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ scraper.js     # Handles the core scraping logic
â”œâ”€â”€ urls.js        # Contains the list of URLs to scrape
â”œâ”€â”€ data.csv       # Output file containing scraped data
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json   # Project configuration and dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md      # Documentation
```

---

## **Error Handling**

- **Invalid Domains**: If a domain cannot be resolved, it will log an error and skip to the next URL.
- **Navigation Errors**: If the scraper cannot access a specific page (e.g., `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`), it logs the issue and continues with other pages.
- **Timeouts**: Pages that take too long to load are skipped to avoid delays.

---

## **Customizing the Scraper**

### Add New Pages to Scrape

Modify the `pagesToScrape` array in `scraper.js` to include additional page paths:

```javascript
const pagesToScrape = [`${url}/contact`, `${url}/contact-us`, `${url}/about`];
```

### Change the Output File

Specify a different file name in `scrape.js`:

```javascript
scrapeAndSaveData(trimmedUrl, "my_custom_data.csv");
```
